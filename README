# Thread Pool and Parallel Game of Life Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a thread pool and parallel Game of Life simulation. The project focuses on developing concurrent software solutions using synchronization techniques and parallel computing paradigms.

## Features
- **Thread Pool:** Implemented a thread pool design pattern for efficient task management.
- **Parallel Game of Life:** Utilized the thread pool pattern for parallel computation of the Game of Life simulation.
- **Synchronization Primitives:** Utilized semaphores, condition variables, and mutexes for coordinated communication between threads.

## Files
- `Semaphore.hpp` and `Semaphore.cpp`: Implementation of a basic semaphore using pthreads library.
- `PCQueue.hpp` and `PCQueue.cpp`: Implementation of a Single-Producer, Multiple-Consumer queue.
- `GameOfLife.cpp`: Implementation of the parallel Game of Life simulation utilizing the thread pool pattern.
- Other supporting files and headers.
